#### 1. Core Financial Management
Transaction Management:
  - Log income and expenses with details like date, amount, and merchant.

Balance Tracking:
- Real-time updates of user balance, integrated with a backend server.
- All budget modifications are made on-the-spot in the databases, including in the user.balance, selected account.balance and transaction.amount.
- Depending on the transaction type, some changes are more precise.
- The home page even gives the user a more detailed insight into their spending habits, by showcasing the amount of money spent in the last month.

Analytics:
- Graphical representation of income and expenses for better financial insights.
- Going through the transactions' database, the graphs are made so that no variation in the budget is missed. 
- There are also multiple time-period options the user can choose from, so that the graphs can be as detailed as desired.

- **Why Youâ€™ll Love It**: With dynamic gameplay and strategic decisions, every round is a battle of wits and luck.
- **A Word of Advice**: Aim for 21, but donâ€™t bust! And if the dealerâ€™s on a hot streak, maybe try Dice Royale instead. ðŸ˜‰

### Workload
- Ariciu Toma: developed the entire logic of making and tracking transactions, which also required making the Portfolio and Transaction pages;
- Brandibur Tudor: devised the initial logic of the server, the first rough design of the website and made the Blackjack game;
- Iliescu Miruna: made the Diceroyal game and was the first to figure out how to create a connection between the server and the games and how to add downloadable execs in the Invest Page;
- Stanciulescu Ana: designed the website so that the user could benefit from a consistent page aspect, which also implied coding the logic of the Home and User pages;

___
### Dificulties
- This project was challenging from start to finish:
  1. It was the first project where we had to also make the frontend. Only Ana Stanciulescu and Tudor Brandibur had some small knowledge on designing websites with HTML from past optional courses. They managed in the end to make the website look pretty through a lot of trial-and-error.
  2. Nobody knew anything about making games. But Miruna Iliescu and Tudor Brandibur took on the challenge. The game logic wasn't as hard to write as making the games communicate with the server. After trying multiple methods of getting the user's balance from the database, the problem was resolved through sending requests to the server by referencing some methods inside it.
  3. Since there were a lot of things to be done in order to finish the project, we ended up simultaneously modifying the server.py, each person on their own branch. This led to multiple conflicts when trying to open a pull request. Some were fixed and merged, others not.
  4. There were also some issues with the databases, but Toma Ariciu fixed them by creating multiple database models with enough fields inside to gain a comprehensive profile on each user.
